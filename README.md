# pack_list

A program to generate a packlist for a trip, based on a series of conditions. Mainly a way for me to practice working with classes and the click command line interface.

## Commands

```bash
python pack_list.py create-pack-list
```

Enter information about trip.

## Sample Output

```bash
[('Jeans', 1), ('Shirts', 3), ('Shorts', 1), ('Dress', 1), ('Underwear', 5)]
[('Laptop', 1), ('PhoneCharger', 2), ('HeadPhones', 2)]
```
